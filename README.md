# Predictive-modelling-of-stem-rot-epidemics
This code base executes feature engineering or variable construction using a window pane approach. Meteorological data collected hourly or daily from the weather stations are used to construct the environmentally-based predictor variables for the model. 
Variable selection and model fitting are done using variety of traditional statistical modelling and Machine Learning Models. Decision tree analysis allowed for the creation of simple and interpretable models
